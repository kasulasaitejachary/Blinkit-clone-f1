# Blinkit Clone ðŸš€

Blinkit is a hyper-fast delivery service, and they will demonstrate how to recreate its website using simple HTML and CSS. They provide the necessary resources and tools required for the project, including a laptop or computer, a web browser, and Visual Studio Code.

The project covers the basics of HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript, and guides viewers through the process of building the Blinkit clone step by step.
Overall you will create a visually impressive website that can be shared on resumes and professional profiles.

There are different sections of the website, including the header, hero section, slider, and other elements. The goal is to recreate these sections exactly.
